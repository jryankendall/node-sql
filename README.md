## Technology
- Javascript, node.js
- MySQL

## Modules
- Inquirer
- mySQL for Node

## About
- This is a node-based command line app. It has two main files, bamazonCustomer and bamazonManager javascript files. When launched, they will bring up the interface for purchasing an item from the database or an interface for viewing and editing the database, respectively. They both access the same database locally and thus changes from one app will affect the other. Developed for an assignment due on April 15, 2019.

## How to use this code
- Requires installation of the inquirer and mysql node packages. If package.json is malfunctioning for you, type `npm i inquirer` and `npm i mysql` to install them.
- This app requires functioning MySQL capability in order for full database. It only accesses a database created locally on the user's machine. Login details should be put into a local `login.js` file in the same directory as the app. Instructions on this are in a block comment in the customer file.
